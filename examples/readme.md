## üîç Examples of Hypergraph-Based Representation for Quantum Circuit Cutting

This section introduces key concepts in **quantum circuit cutting** using **hypergraph representations**, a central methodology in the **HyPAQ framework**. Below, we walk through several illustrative figures demonstrating how quantum circuits are transformed into graph and hypergraph models to enable efficient partitioning across distributed quantum computing systems.

### üñºÔ∏è [Figure 1: Graph vs. Hypergraph Representations](https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig1.png)

</p>

This figure compares **graphs** and **hypergraphs** for modeling quantum circuits:
- **Graph (left)**: Represents **binary relationships** between qubits (e.g., a CX gate between `q2` and `q5`).
- **Hypergraph (middle)**: Captures **multi-qubit gates** (e.g., a CCX gate represented by `e3`), where **hyperedges** connect more than two qubits.
- **Bipartite Graph (right)**: Translates the hypergraph into a bipartite structure, making the relationships between qubits and gates explicit for computational purposes.

Hypergraphs are essential for accurately representing **non-binary interactions** in quantum circuits.

### üñºÔ∏è [Figure 2: From Quantum Circuit to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig2.png)

<p align="center">

</p>

This figure shows how a **quantum circuit** (left) can be converted into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** (right):
- **Circuit**: Composed of gates and qubits (`q0` to `q5`).
- **DAG**: Represents **dependencies** between operations, with nodes as gates and edges showing the **execution order**. Weights indicate **latency** or **communication costs**.

DAGs help visualize the **flow of computation** and assist in **scheduling** and **partitioning** for distributed execution.

### üñºÔ∏è [Figure 3: Binary Gates and Graph-Based Partitioning](https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig3.png)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig3.png" alt="Graph vs. Hypergraph" width="70%">
</p>

In this example:
- The **circuit (left)** consists of **binary gates** only.
- The **graph (right)** models these pairwise interactions between qubits.

For **binary-only circuits**, graph-based partitioning suffices. However, for **multi-qubit gates**, a **hypergraph** becomes necessary.

### üñºÔ∏è [Figure 4: Multi-Qubit Gates and Hypergraph-Based Partitioning](https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig4.png)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig4.png" alt="Graph vs. Hypergraph" width="70%">
</p>

Here:
- The **quantum circuit (left)** includes **multi-qubit gates** like **CCX** (Toffoli gates), such as `e4` and `e5`.
- The **hypergraph (right)** captures these **multi-qubit dependencies**, allowing **hyperedges** to connect more than two qubits.

This representation supports **quantum circuit cutting**, enabling **efficient partitioning** across **multiple QPUs**.

### üñºÔ∏è [Figure 5: Hypergraph Structure for Circuit Representation](https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig5.png)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hypaq/hypaq/blob/main/images/fig5.png" alt="Graph vs. Hypergraph" width="70%">
</p>

This figure details the **hypergraph structure** used to represent complex quantum circuits:
- **Nodes** represent **qubits**, while **hyperedges** represent **quantum gates**, including multi-qubit gates.
- The **data structure** (right) shows how nodes and hyperedges are encoded, with additional attributes from quantum gates (e.g., qubit identifiers, gate types).

This **flexible hypergraph model** captures various patterns and complexities from input circuits, forming the foundation for **partitioning** and **distributing circuits** in **multi-QPU systems**.
