# HyPAQ - Hypergraph Partitioning for Static and Adaptive Quantum Circuits

## Introduction

Quantum computing stands at the forefront of technological innovation, promising to revolutionize fields ranging from cryptography to material science by leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics. Central to the advancement of quantum computing is the development of efficient and scalable quantum circuits, which serve as the fundamental building blocks for quantum algorithms. Traditional static quantum circuits, while powerful, often face limitations in flexibility and efficiency, particularly as the complexity of quantum algorithms increases.

With the advancement of quantum computing, scaling algorithms to multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) is essential to overcoming the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, significant challenges remain, such as the high communication cost between QPUs and the need for more efficient architectures to manage both static and adaptive circuits. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the scalability and performance of quantum computations in distributed systems.

In recent years, adaptive quantum circuits have emerged as a compelling alternative to static circuits. Unlike their static counterparts, adaptive circuits possess the ability to dynamically adjust their structure and parameters in real-time based on intermediate measurement outcomes. This adaptability enhances both the flexibility and efficiency of quantum computations, enabling more responsive and optimized processing of quantum information. However, the dynamic nature of adaptive circuits introduces significant challenges in their design, optimization, and partitioning, necessitating novel approaches to effectively manage their complexity.

A critical aspect of optimizing quantum circuits, whether static or adaptive, is the partitioning of qubits and gates to minimize resource usage and maximize performance. Traditional partitioning techniques often fall short when applied to adaptive circuits due to their inherent dynamism and the intricate dependencies introduced by intermediate measurements. To address this, hypergraph representations have been proposed as a robust framework for modeling adaptive quantum circuits. In this representation, groups of quantum gates are encapsulated as hyperedges, allowing for a more nuanced depiction of gate interactions and dependencies. This extended hypergraph not only captures the structural intricacies of adaptive circuits but also integrates constraints that are pivotal during the partitioning process, ensuring that groups of ports associated with classical operations are preserved.

Recognizing the need for standardized benchmarks to evaluate and advance partitioning techniques for both static and adaptive quantum circuits, this paper introduces HYPAQ (Hypergraphic Partitioning Approach for Quantum circuits). HYPAQ is specifically designed for distributed quantum computing environments, where algorithms are scaled across multiple QPUs. By leveraging hypergraph representations, HYPAQ employs advanced partitioning heuristics to optimize the distribution of quantum circuits, thereby minimizing communication costs and enhancing computational efficiency in multi-QPU systems.

To facilitate the evaluation of HYPAQ, we present a comprehensive dataset of benchmark quantum circuits. This dataset is meticulously curated to encompass a diverse array of quantum algorithms and configurations, tailored to assess both static and adaptive circuit approaches. By providing this dataset, we aim to offer the research community a valuable resource that facilitates the comparative analysis of different partitioning heuristics and optimization strategies. The availability of such standardized benchmarks is essential for driving forward the development of more efficient and effective quantum circuit methodologies.

HYPAQ introduces several key strategies based on hypergraph representations:

1. Weighted Hypergraph Partitioning: This approach segments static circuits into smaller subcircuits, reducing inter-QPU operations and speeding up the partitioning process. It accommodates both balanced and unbalanced scenarios, effectively lowering communication costs in complex circuits.
   
2. Reduced Hypergraph Representation: For larger circuits, HYPAQ applies the same heuristic to a reduced hypergraph, achieving cuts with lower communication costs compared to classical bipartite methods.

3. Co-Design Model for Adaptive Circuits: Addressing the unique challenges of adaptive circuits, this model considers real-time execution dynamics, ensuring that the partitioning process accommodates the dynamic adjustments inherent to adaptive quantum computations.

4. Quantum Resource Manager Architecture: To coordinate partitions of both static and adaptive circuits, we present a quantum resource manager architecture that meets the practical requirements for scalable multi-QPU systems.

Through rigorous testing on our benchmark circuits, HYPAQ demonstrates superior performance in maintaining the integrity of classical operation groups and optimizing qubit interactions. The comparative analysis between static and adaptive methods underscores the efficacy of our hypergraph-based approach, highlighting significant improvements in partitioning efficiency and overall circuit performance.

Experimental results validate our theoretical insights, showcasing significant reductions in communication costs between partitions and enhanced partitioning performance in complex circuits. These findings highlight the practical benefits of utilizing hypergraph representations for both static and adaptive quantum computing within distributed systems. By publishing our benchmark dataset alongside the HYPAQ methodology, we aim to foster ongoing research and collaboration within the quantum computing community, ultimately contributing to the realization of more powerful and scalable quantum technologies.

These contributions collectively advance the state-of-the-art in adaptive and distributed quantum circuit optimization and offer foundational tools for researchers aiming to push the boundaries of quantum computing capabilities.
