## üìù Description

The **HYPAQ** project (Hypergraphic Partitioning Approach for Quantum circuits) is a research-driven initiative aimed at addressing key scalability and efficiency challenges in distributed quantum computing. At its core, HYPAQ focuses on the development of advanced partitioning strategies for both static and adaptive quantum circuits by leveraging hypergraph-based representations. These representations enable a more precise modeling of quantum gate dependencies and classical control operations, which are particularly complex in adaptive circuits. The main goal of HYPAQ is to optimize the distribution of quantum computations across multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), reducing inter-QPU communication costs and enhancing overall computational performance. By introducing standardized benchmarks and heuristics tailored for multi-QPU systems, HYPAQ provides a foundational framework for evaluating and improving partitioning techniques‚Äîultimately facilitating more scalable, efficient, and flexible quantum algorithm execution in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

## Introduction

HYPAQ introduces several key strategies based on hypergraph representations:

1. Weighted Hypergraph Partitioning: This approach segments static circuits into smaller subcircuits, reducing inter-QPU operations and speeding up the partitioning process. It accommodates both balanced and unbalanced scenarios, effectively lowering communication costs in complex circuits.
   
2. Reduced Hypergraph Representation: For larger circuits, HYPAQ applies the same heuristic to a reduced hypergraph, achieving cuts with lower communication costs compared to classical bipartite methods.

3. Co-Design Model for Adaptive Circuits: Addressing the unique challenges of adaptive circuits, this model considers real-time execution dynamics, ensuring that the partitioning process accommodates the dynamic adjustments inherent to adaptive quantum computations.

4. Quantum Resource Manager Architecture: To coordinate partitions of both static and adaptive circuits, we present a quantum resource manager architecture that meets the practical requirements for scalable multi-QPU systems.

Through rigorous testing on our benchmark circuits, HYPAQ demonstrates superior performance in maintaining the integrity of classical operation groups and optimizing qubit interactions. The comparative analysis between static and adaptive methods underscores the efficacy of our hypergraph-based approach, highlighting significant improvements in partitioning efficiency and overall circuit performance.

Experimental results validate our theoretical insights, showcasing significant reductions in communication costs between partitions and enhanced partitioning performance in complex circuits. These findings highlight the practical benefits of utilizing hypergraph representations for both static and adaptive quantum computing within distributed systems. By publishing our benchmark dataset alongside the HYPAQ methodology, we aim to foster ongoing research and collaboration within the quantum computing community, ultimately contributing to the realization of more powerful and scalable quantum technologies.

These contributions collectively advance the state-of-the-art in adaptive and distributed quantum circuit optimization and offer foundational tools for researchers aiming to push the boundaries of quantum computing capabilities.
